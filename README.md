## Installation Guide

In order to install and run the project, you will first need to download some things:
1. <a href="https://www.apachefriends.org">XAMPP</a> - Our cross-platform web server of choice. It includes Apache, MySQL, PHP, and Perl. 
Once installed, open the application and click "Manage Servers". Click on MySQL Database, ProFTPD, Apache web server and click "Start" on each one. Now our servers are running!
2. After this is done, go to your browser, type in "localhost", then hit enter. This will direct you to your localhost homepage. Click "phpMyAdmin". This will take you to the MySQL database.
3. Click lick "new". Create a database, name it "phonestore" and hit "Create". Now that we have our database made, we need to import everything from the store!
4. Head over to the master branch of this repository and download the project. Once the download is complete, go to the project and open the "phonestore.sql" file. This file contains all the store items, users, and admin accounts that we will import into our database.  
5. Copy and paste all the SQL queries into the database you created in step 3. Now all the data that we need has been uploaded to the database!
6. Finally, open up the GuzmanDomingoPHP project you downloaded and go to the index.php file. Copy the link and paste it on your browser. Before hitting enter, replace the localhost port number on the link if yours is different. You are now ready to register and use the application!!! Enjoy!
